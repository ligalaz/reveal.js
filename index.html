            "Scrum" is a framework, an author's agile development method with a non-standard distribution of roles in a
            team and a unique organization of iterations. Scrum, like other agile-project management methods, promotes a
            team approach, short iterations, and continuous improvement in the process. These principles are implemented
            through a set of specific roles, rules, processes, and tools that help teams produce products in half the
            time.

            The peculiarity of Scrum lies in the team approach and non-standard distribution of responsibilities within
            the team. The process involves not only company employees, but also business customers, who should be
            included in the process of creating a product more often than with other approaches, and do this mainly in
            personal communication, and not through documents

              Scrum is a role-playing framework. The basic unit is a small group of people, usually no more than ten.
              The team consists of: scrum master, product owner, developers. The Scrum team is quite mobile and
              self-organized and performs all product activities: cooperation with stakeholders, verification,
              maintenance, operation, development, and everything that the business requires. The entire Scrum team is
              responsible for creating a valuable, useful product and is open to change.

                improve the product. This is the only source of work done by the Scrum Team. Product Backlog's
                commitment is Product Goal. The Product Goal is the long-term expected outcome of the Scrum Team. They

                of readiness is a description of the state of an increment in which it meets the quality requirements.
                If multiple Scrum Teams are working on a common product, they must jointly define and adhere to the same
                definition of readiness.

            parties. A multifunctional professional development team is hired, which is ready to solve a different range
            of tasks.
